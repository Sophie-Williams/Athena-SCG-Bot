    <h3>Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      You should have recived the Starting Player as a JAR (Java
      ARchive) or a Tar/GZip file.  It should include all the source,
      shell scripts and other files needed to get you started.  The
      only difference between the two that the TarGZip file includes
      the 'Player' base directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The JAR is runnable, and you can test it with:
      <pre>
    java -cp $CLASSPATH:player.jar player.PlayerMain
      </pre>
      If you get errors, then most likely
      the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/chadwick/demeterf/demeterf.jar">DemeterF
      JAR</a> is not correctly in your classpath.  The Tar/GZip file
      can be unpacked into your Eclipse workspace, and imported.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Files and Organization</h3>
    <p>
      The starting player is organized as an Eclipse project. It can
      be unpacked into a workspace directory (TarGZip version contains
      it's own base directory).  The directories are organized as
      follows:

      <pre>
    Player/
       PlayerTest.java
       makeJar.sh
       runPlayer.sh

       files/
          context.txt
    
       player/
          PlayerMain.java
          Register.java
          Player.java
          player.mf
          PlayerServer.java
        
          tasks/
             SolveTask.java
             ReofferTask.java
             AcceptTask.java
             OfferTask.java
             ProvideTask.java
      </pre>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><span class="file">Player/</span>: Base directory, contains all the sources.
      Feel free to rename this for your player.</li>

      <li><span class="file">PlayerTest.java</span>: A simple Test class for the
      Player. </li>

      <li><span class="file">makeJar.sh</span>: Script used to make the JAR
      distribution. </li>

      <li><span class="file">makeTar.sh</span>: Script used to make the Tar/GZip
      distribution. </li>

      <li><span class="file">files/</span>: Use this to put any test (non-java) files or
      other configuration files for your player.  Currently there's
      only one file, used to test the Player with a simple
      context.</li>

      <li><span class="file">context.txt</span>: Contains a simple PlayerContext to test
      the Player classes.  See PlayerTest.java for how we use
      it. </li>

      <li><span class="file">player/</span>: The <tt>player</tt> package, for all things
      Player related.</li>

      <li><span class="file">PlayerMain.java</span>: The Main class for running the
      Player; everything starts here. </li>

      <li><span class="file">Register.java</span>: Competitions
      require registration with the Administrator.  This class handles
      that, and can be used/run to register a Player seperately for
      testing or multiple competitions. </li>

      <li><span class="file">Player.java</span>: Deligation point for
      the Player tasks.  Created with a <tt>PlayerContext</tt> and
      a <tt>Logger</tt>. When <tt>play()</tt> is called it inturn
      calls each of the player tasks, to create a final
      <tt>PlayerTransaction</tt>.</li>

      <li><span class="file">player.mf</span>: A JAR manifest file for
      the Player.  This is included in the JAR to make it runnable,
      though there needs to be a good amount of CLASSPATH setup before
      it will work with <tt>java -jar player.jar</tt> </li>

      <li><span class="file">PlayerServer.java</span>: The HTTP server
      portion of the Player.  This class handles the setup/binding of
      the server, and interaction with the Administrator over
      sockets.</li>

      <li><span class="file">tasks/</span>: Package that contains the
      Player's tasks/functions. </li>

      <li><span class="file">SolveTask.java</span>: A
      basic <tt>Solution</tt> task.  Basically creates a random
      assignment for the variables of the given <tt>Problem</tt>. </li>

      <li><span class="file">ReofferTask.java</span>: Reoffers all
      the <tt>Challenge</tt>s from others.  This is used when the
      Player doesn't find challenges worth accepting. </li>

      <li><span class="file">AcceptTask.java</span>: Figure out what
      challenges to accept.  This is currently done randomly, but you
      should add more intelligence.  </li>

      <li><span class="file">OfferTask.java</span>: Creates new
      challenges to be offered.  Currently random, but you should
      offer challenges based on more information.</li>

      <li><span class="file">ProvideTask.java</span>:
      Provides <tt>Problem</tt>s (once accepted) for others to
      solve.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>More Information</h3>
    <p>
      The source files themsleves contain lots of comments and, of
      course, the code that makes things work.  Read through them to
      see what we were thinking when the classes were
      organized/written.  We will also provide a document on testing
      your Player with an Administrator instance both on your own, and
      with others... look for that soon.
